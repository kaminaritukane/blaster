A test UE5 project including many shooting game features that can be used in my future indie game

UE version: 5.3

How to run: 
1. Open with UE editor v5.3
2. Set "Number of Players" to 2 to 4, "Net Mode" to "Play As Listen Server"
3. Hit the play button

You can also build and try it via LAN, but to do that, you need to install steam to your PC and run steam before playing.
